# ImageSlider

I have Created this Image Slider Using HTML,CSS and Js(owl carousel).
The first image is an active image by default however user can slide 
through all the other images either clicking on side icons or clicking dots
at the end.
The Number of dots at the end represent the totall number of images.

Thanks!
